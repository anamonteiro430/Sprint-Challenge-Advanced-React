- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
      Before hooks, class components were more eficient because we got to use man functionalities that just didn't work using functional components.

Even if now, functional components are capable of doing the same things as class components, there are still class components in the wild and in many codebases. So I need to learn how to use them.

I would use class instead of functional components in some cases:
React lifecycles methods can't be used on functional components.
